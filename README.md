It is a Django based project. Developed to ease the management at the hospital. 

The developed system solves 3 main issues:
1. Patients dont have to wait in line as appointment for the doctor will be taken prior.
2. Medicines can be given online for minor health issues.
3. Medical history of the patient is stored digitally to recognize if the patient is prone to any allergies etc.

There are 3 types of login:
1. Patient: Can view and take appointment for respective doctors, view the prescribed medicines.
2. Doctor: View the medical history of the patient, prescribe medicine, see upcoming appointments
3. Admin: Manage the users of the system

Simply download/clone the repository. Import the database. Run the index.html.
Host the project on pythonanywhere cloud for free.
